## What Is SafeCard?

SafeCard is an RFID-blocking card designed to prevent unauthorized scanning of your credit cards, debit cards, IDs, and passports. With military-grade shielding technology, SafeCard acts as a protective barrier inside your wallet, blocking unwanted RFID signals used by criminals to steal personal and financial data remotely.

Unlike traditional bulky RFID-blocking wallets or purses, SafeCard is slim, lightweight, and easy to use. It fits seamlessly into any wallet without adding unnecessary bulk while delivering maximum security against cyber threats.

## How Does SafeCard Work?

SafeCard functions using advanced RFID-blocking technology, which prevents unauthorized wireless scanning of RFID-enabled cards. Most modern credit cards, IDs, and passports contain RFID chips that transmit sensitive data wirelessly to make transactions faster and more convenient.

However, cybercriminals use RFID skimming devices to intercept these signals and steal your personal data without even touching your cards. SafeCard counteracts this by creating a protective shield around your wallet, disrupting RFID signals and rendering unauthorized scans ineffective.
